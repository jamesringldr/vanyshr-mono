## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Dev-only admin manual scan page at `/admin/manual-scan` to upload broker HTML (FastPeopleSearch, AnyWho, Zabasearch) and merge results into a scan via the `admin-parse-html` edge function
- `admin-parse-html` Supabase Edge Function for batch HTML parsing, profile merge, and optional `quick_scans.profile_data` persistence (`verify_jwt = false` for pre-auth flows)
- `FastPeopleSearchScraper` and shared HTML parse helpers on the scraper router (`parseSearchFromHtml`, `parseDetailFromHtml`, `mergeProfileData`)
- Internal research doc: `docs/fps-bypass-strategies.md` (FastPeopleSearch bypass strategies)

### Changed

- Pre-profile page loads saved `profile_data` when present (e.g. after manual admin upload) instead of being overridden by stub `selectedProfile` state
- Pre-profile UI: two-column list previews with “N More…”, improved alias normalization, address parsing, and relative age handling
- Zabasearch and AnyWho scrapers updated to align with shared parse/merge patterns used by admin HTML ingestion
